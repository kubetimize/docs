## Getting Started

### Installation

1. **Platform-Based Installation:**
   - Sign up at [Kubetimize Platform](https://www.kubetimize.io).
   - Download the Kubetimize agent for your Kubernetes cluster.
   - Follow the setup wizard to register your cluster.

2. **On-Premises Installation:**
   - Clone the Kubetimize repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/kubetimize/kubetimize-agent.git
     ```
   - Deploy the agent using Helm or kubectl:
     ```bash
     helm install kubetimize-agent ./charts
     ```

## Using Kubetimize

### Cluster Insights

Gain visibility into:
- CPU and memory usage per node and pod.
- Node and pod pricing across cloud providers.
- Historical trends and projections.

Access cluster insights via the web dashboard or API endpoint:
```http
GET /v1/cluster/{org_id}/{cluster_id}/insights
```
Access organization insights via the web dashboard or API endpoint:
```http
GET /v1/organization/{org_id}/insights
```

### Recommendations

Get AI-driven recommendations for optimizing your cluster:
```http
GET /v1/getrecommendation/{org_id}/{cluster_id}
```
- **Node Right-Sizing**: Match node types to workload requirements.
- **Workload Distribution**: Balance workloads across nodes.

## Automation

Automate your Kubernetes cluster management with Kubetimize. Define and update automation configurations to optimize workloads and resource allocation.

### Retrieve Automation Configurations
Fetch the current automation settings for your cluster:

```http
GET /v1/state/{org_id}/{cluster_id}

Modify automation settings for workloads dynamically, Use this endpoint to update workload automation parameters, including scheduling, scaling rules, and cost optimizations:

```http
POST /v1/workloads/update/{org_id}/{cluster_id}



### Node Optimization

Kubetimize allows you to:
- Identify and delete underutilized nodes.
- Schedule node scaling based on demand.

Example:
```bash
kubetimize-cli optimize --cluster-id=my-cluster
```

---

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Node Types
- Add or modify node types using the Kubetimize Planner.
- Enable custom launch templates for EC2 nodes in AWS.

Example:
```yaml
nodeTypes:
  - name: custom-large
    cpu: 8
    memory: 16GB
```

### Security Policies
- Define policies for workload access.
- Integrate with IAM roles for advanced permission management.

## FAQ

**Q1: How does Kubetimize calculate cost savings?**
A1: Cost savings are calculated based on the reduction in node and pod usage after optimization.

**Q2: Can Kubetimize run in air-gapped environments?**
A2: Yes, Kubetimize supports air-gapped deployments with minimal external dependencies.

**Q3: What if my cluster has no internet access?**
A3: Kubetimize agents can send data securely to your backend or store insights locally.

## API Key for On-Premises Installation

To ensure secure communication with the Kubetimize backend, an API key is required for on-premises installations. Follow these steps:

1. **Generate Your API Key:**
   - Log in to the Kubetimize platform.
   - Navigate to **Account Settings > API Keys**.
   - Generate and copy your unique API key.

2. **Set the API Key in Your Environment:**
   Add the following line to your server's environment configuration:
   ```env
   KUBETIMIZE_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
   ```

3. **Validate API Key Communication:**
   Test the connection using cURL or a similar tool:
   ```bash
   curl -X GET "https://api.kubetimize.io/v1/status" \
   -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY"
   ```
